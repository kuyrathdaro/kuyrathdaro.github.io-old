## My Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website hobby project.

First, run the development server:

git clone https://github.com/kuyrathdaro/kuyrathdaro.github.io.git

npm install
# or
yarn install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npx next dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
